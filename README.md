I'm a 43 years young male (was never fond of the "years old" term) who loves Creating and Optimizing. If i ever start a business, i just want to be the CaO :) 
I'm an easy going person with the capability of adapting to most environments and situations.
I have an open mind for change and a constant desire to learn more and absorb useful information.
I'm a resourceful problem solver with an analytic/creative mind mix, which can see things from outside the box, while checking ways to improve and optimize processes.
I worked most of my life in the retail after-sales area, managing spare-parts stocks at start, and then people and their tasks. Along that path, my main motivation was allways organizing and optimizing, so i taught myself how to work with databases and created a lot of solutions to improve people's work quality and reduce workloads, so they could focus in more important stuff.
I'm now working towards becoming a frontend developer, but i aim to learn backend aswell in order to become a fullstack developer. I'm hoping that with those skills, i will be able to help people (not just my team) improve their work processes, aswell as their personal life, by letting the microchips do the boring tasks for them.
I see a future where softskills will top the hierarchy of job descriptions, with creativity being the most required.
So what about the rest of the stuff? Ahh well, let them machines do it.
